    <h1>Cycling</h1>
    <div id="bike">	
    <p>I have been cycling for most of my life already. Unfortunately, I lost interest during the quarantine and stopped going on rides for a while, but just last year I picked it back up and even bought myself a new bike! I used to ride a mountain bike but now I ride a fixed gear bike. This means that only have one gear that is fixed to my back tire, which means that if my back tire is spinning, so are my pedals. So I basically cannot coast. Some people may say it is a weird and terrible style of bike to ride (especially for the price I bought it for) ,but I love it since I feel most connected to my bike when I ride fixed gear.</p>

    <p>Here I am at the Bloomingdale trail, also known as the 606 trail, with my brother. We try to go bike there every week since it is the best way to get easy miles on your bike.</p>

    <p>Here is a video, showcasing the trail! I think it is a pretty good ride for beginners since it is a relatively linear path and it is not very long of a ride.</p>
